Lab 4.1 - Variables and Functions
Student Dewan Mahmud Per Scholas Software Engineering Program

++++++++++++++++Practice makes a man perfect+++++++++++++++++++

I am learning JavaScript by building simple functions and connecting them to a web page. 
This README will update as I make progress and learn more.

Task Notes
I completed each task step by step to understand how functions work and how to connect JavaScript to the webpage. I also followed examples and best practices from MDN Web Docs and W3Schools while learning. Here is what I did in each task:

Task 1: Flexible String Manipulation with Functions
I created a function to format a full name. I learned how to change text so the first letter is capitalized and the rest is lowercase. I checked if the user typed both first and last names.

Task 2: Mathematical Operations with Multiple Parameters
I built a function that calculates the total cost with tax. I practiced using numbers and multiplication. I added input checks to make sure the values were valid numbers.

Task 3: Functions with Conditional Logic
I used conditional logic to check eligibility based on age and employment. I used nested if statements instead of && because it helped me understand the logic better.

Task 4: Refactoring for Reusability
I updated the cost calculation to include an optional discount. I learned how to refactor a function and make it more reusable without breaking the original logic.

What I have learned so far
How to create and use functions in JavaScript
How to format names and text
How to calculate with numbers in code
How to use if statements to check conditions

Tools used
HTML
JavaScript
Web browser console for testing (Google Chrome is my preferred browser for testing in the console.)

How to run the project
1 Open index.html in a web browser
2 Type in values and click the buttons to see results
3 Check console if needed (Mine is Google)

Reflection
Q: How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
A: I used parameters so one function can work with different values. This makes my code reusable instead of writing the same code again and again.

Q: What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
A: Sometimes I got confused with different conditions and results, especially when checking multiple cases. Testing helped me find mistakes and fix them.

Q: How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
A: Refactoring makes my code cleaner and easier to understand. It also helps me update the code later without breaking other parts.
